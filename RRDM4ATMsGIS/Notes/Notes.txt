Google Geocoding Web Service via HTTP .NET client implemented in request(GeoRequest)-response(GeoResponse) fashion.
Installation & Usage

In order to use the GoogleGecoding you have to:
add reference to Artem.GoogleGeocoding
add using statement for Artem.Google.Net namespace.
Features

Support standard and reverse geocoding;
Samples

Geocoding Request
    GeoRequest request = new GeoRequest("plovdiv bulgaria");
    GeoResponse response = request.GetResponse();
    GeoLocation location = response.Results[0].Geometry.Location;
    double latitude = location.Latitude;
    double longitude = location.Longitude;
    // TODO use latitude/longitude values

Reverse Geocoding Request
    GeoRequest request = new GeoRequest(42.1438409, 24.7495615);
    GeoResponse response = request.GetResponse();
    string address = response.Results[0].FormattedAddress;
    // TODO use address values


Status Codes
--------------
The "status" field within the Geocoding response object contains the status of the request, and may contain debugging information 
to help you track down why geocoding is not working. The "status" field may contain the following values:

"OK" indicates that no errors occurred; the address was successfully parsed and at least one geocode was returned.
"ZERO_RESULTS" indicates that the geocode was successful but returned no results. This may occur if the geocoder was passed a non-existent address.
"OVER_QUERY_LIMIT" indicates that you are over your quota.
"REQUEST_DENIED" indicates that your request was denied.
"INVALID_REQUEST" generally indicates that the query (address, components or latlng) is missing.
"UNKNOWN_ERROR" indicates that the request could not be processed due to a server error. The request may succeed if you try again.


Error Messages
---------------
When the geocoder returns a status code other than OK, there may be an additional error_message field within the Geocoding response object. 
This field contains more detailed information about the reasons behind the given status code.


Location Type
-------------------
location_type stores additional data about the specified location. The following values are currently supported:

"ROOFTOP" 
		indicates that the returned result is a precise geocode for which we have location information accurate down to street address precision.
"RANGE_INTERPOLATED" 
		indicates that the returned result reflects an approximation (usually on a road) interpolated between two precise points (such as intersections). Interpolated results are generally returned when rooftop geocodes are unavailable for a street address.
"GEOMETRIC_CENTER" 
		indicates that the returned result is the geometric center of a result such as a polyline (for example, a street) or polygon (region).
"APPROXIMATE" 
		indicates that the returned result is approximate.
