## Guidelines
###1. The 'master' branch must be deployable at all times!
Before committing to 'master' you must make sure that the code is rebuild-able and tested!
###2. All your daily activities must be based off of the 'Dev' branch!
Code in the 'Dev' branch must have also been tested and be rebuild-able. This is where other developers will PULL from
###3. Commits must represent a self sufficient unit of work!
For long standing commits, consider using local branches and rebasing at the local level before commiting to the remote repository.
###4. Commit messages must be descriptive of the unit of work!
The first line must not be longer than 50 characters and must be a concise description of the work done. For additional information, leave a blank line after the first one, and add as many lines as necessary
